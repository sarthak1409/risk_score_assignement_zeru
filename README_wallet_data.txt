This folder contains the raw transaction data for all Ethereum wallets used in this risk scoring project.

Each file is a `.json` exported from Covalent API containing the full transaction history for a single wallet.

⚠️ However, the `wallet_data/` folder has NOT been uploaded to this GitHub repo due to:
- Privacy reasons — the wallet addresses and activities are confidential for interview submission.
- GitHub size limits — raw transaction data exceeds 10MB total size.

📝 If required, the dataset can be regenerated using the provided Python notebook and the `wallet_id` list inside `wallet_features.csv`.

Thank you!
